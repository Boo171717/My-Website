    <p><b>My homework</b></p>
    <img src="http://sproutsdevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/homework2.jpg" width="304" height="236">
    <p>This kid has less homework than I have on a normal daily basis. Conclusion: my school has WAY too much homework. In November, my Science Teacher posted 23 assignments and projects due before December. The other teachers only give 30 minutes a night, but when there are 7 other classes, that amounts to around 3 1/2 hours. I like this picture because it shows why my school should stop giving so much homework or we will end up like this kid.</p>

    <p><b>Math</b></p>
    <img src="http://patersontimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Math.jpg" width="304" height="236">
    <p>Math is my favorite subject in school, but also the most boring subject in school sometimes. Allow me to explain- I like math when I learn new things in school, like Fermat primes. I think math is boring when I am learning math that is simple to me- how to add and subtract negative numbers. We are learning that now... don't blame me if I try to fall asleep- I NEED SLEEP! I like this picture because this is some advanced math that hopefully will be taught in 7th grade so that I am not bored out of my mind (I mean the functions at the bottom).</p>

    <p><b>My Favorite Mobile Game</p></b>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Vainglory_app_icon_%28rounded_edges%29.png" width="304" height="236">
    <p>This is my favorite mobile game in the history of mobile games (I haven't lived that long). It is a game where people choose a hero that they want to be and then they are on a team of three (two other people that live somewhere far away), trying to kill the heroes of the other team of three. It's that simple, and addicting... I only like to play mobile games because they are addicting... yep, that's the reason (not because I actually enjoy them). I like this picture because it literally spells out the name of the game, and is the logo of the game- it's a pretty cool logo.</p>

    <p><b>My Favorite Movie</p></b>
    <img src="https://cdn.movieweb.com/img.news.tops/NEicQO0A0fDxlm_2_b/Bloodsport-Remake-Will-Not-Star-Jean-Claude-Van.jpg" width="304" height="236">
    <p>I know what you are probably thinking- this is an 80's movie- it's not good! That's not true- Bloodsport is my favorite movie. It is about this guy named Frank who escapes from the military to participate in a no-holds-barred MMA tournament (means people can be killed) held in Hong Kong. Frank makes friends, and wins the rounds that lead up to the finals. His opponent has already tried to kill all of his opponents, and has sucessfully done it once (also snapped a knee bone, banged someone on the head really hard, etc.). His opponent cheats, but Frank still wins. I like this picture because Frank is so confident, but almost gets knocked to the ground in a split second. I think that this picture is of him in the start of the tournament. The film is about overcoming evil, which is why I like it so much. He also did the whole contest to honor his trainer, who led him from a life of crime to a life of justice.</p>

    <p><b>My Favorite Book</p></b>
    <img src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1379964908l/901.jpg" width="304" height="236">
    <p>You probably thought that my favorite book is Bloodsport, but I don't think that there is a Bloodsport book, and either way, it wouldn't be. My favorite book always will be Ender's Game. This book is about this 6-year old named Ender (Andrew) Wiggin who gets recruited by International Military Forces to save the world from destruction (aliens called Buggers). He gets taken away to go to Battle School (which is in space) and the teachers start isolating him to make sure that he becomes a commander, and pure genius. He gets promoted to different armies, and Ender becomes a commander later. He defeats the Buggers with the help of the guy that did it first- Mazer Rackham. This was a very short summary of the most awesome book on that planet. I like this picture because it shows how Ender feels isolated- it is also the cover page of the book. Ender looks like a prisoner in Battle School (which he kind of is in the book). The theme of the book is compassion, which essentially defines Ender's existence. </p>

    <p><b>My Favorite Sport</p></b>
    <img src="http://www.trbimg.com/img-55303a0e/turbine/sc-hlth-0422-fencing-for-fitness-20150416" width="304" height="236">
    <p>My favorite sport is fencing, as shown by the picture above. I like fencing because it is exciting for me to have to use a sword (I use sabre) in so many ways at once. For instance, there are 9 different parries, many different counterattacks, multiple movement speeds that are used at different times, feints, beats, and reposts, among other things. Fencing is the only sport I actually compete in- though, in my first tournament, I got second to last place... I like this picture because the person to the right is doing what I usually do when I am in defense (almost all the time)- he is counterattacking while retreating. </p>

    <p><b>My Favorite Animal</b></p>

    <p>My favorite animal is a Komodo Dragon. Komodo Dragons are the largest living lizards in the world- they are very big. THey can run up to 13 mph, but they usually hunt by stealth. They are the top predators in the land they inhabit... even humans try not to mess with them. Yes- they can eat humans. Yes- they try to eat each other sometimes. They have poisonous saliva- so if the prey doesn't die after they shred it with their teeth, it will die of poisoning at most 24 hours after. I like this picture because it shows how even though Komodo Dragons are super bulky, they can run pretty quickly, which is why my dad ran away from one of them with his tourist group. </p>

    <p><b>My Favorite Food</b></p>

    <p>My favorite food is candy- more specifically, Sour Patch Kids. This is because one second the candy is sour, and then the next second, the candy is sweet. This is what the label says, and it is true. I like this picture because there are a variety of colors in the Sour Patch Kids, which is great for advertising. There are also so many Sour Patches, which makes my mouth water inside. These components of Sour Patch Kids makes it great for advertising, which makes them even more money. Hopefully, they never go out of business (fingers crossed)!!!! </p>

    <p><b>My Favorite Board Game</p></b>
    <img src="https://www.catan.com/sites/all/themes/catan/images/start-gameplan_mayfair_neu.png" width="304" height="236">
    <p>My favorite board game is Settlers of Catan. It is a very unpopular board game, even though it is extremely fun. In this picture, the people that are playing are in the middle of the game. Settlers of Catan is a fairly complicated game, so only the most basic rules will be explained. The objective of the game is to have victory points, which can be achieved by placing roads and houses on strategic points if the person has the right materials. In this particular game, it seems as if the blue player is winning because he/she has access to the most materials, and is closer to a port. I like this picture because it shows people in the middle of gameplay, and one player more dominant than the other. This gives a sense of how fun Settlers of Catan can be even if it looks like just another board game. </p>

    <p><b>The Artificial Intelligence Disaster</p></b>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GQm0ZlcZVltBd_9XwJGyNw.jpeg" width="304" height="236">
    <p>I know what you are thinking- how is AI a disaster? It really is. This is a topic that I am really interested in. Hear me out first. My best friend and I had a long conversation about how humanity is doomed, whether it is the Sun exploding or AI killing us all (the most probable one-the newest problem). Humanity has to be careful with the idea of robots- even Stephen Hawking said it- he is one smart dude. Robots could become self-aware and self-conscious and suddenly turn against us. It could be like a reprise of what the Nazis did- only robots will survive, and all humans will work as slaves. That is why, like what Elon Musk said, there needs to be a button that could kill all of the robots. But again, the robots are smarter, stronger, and faster than us, so they would probably pull out the destruct chip. Designer babies as well- these are babies that have genes changed by doctors to make them smarter, stronger, faster, etc. than the average human being. Either way, the future is scary. I could ramble on and on about it, but I don't want to waste your time with all of this future nonsense. I like this picture because it shows what I mentioned earlier- how humans could work as slaves for AI.
